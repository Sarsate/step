        <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
        <p>
        Hey! My name is Christopher Desir, but people that know me (which includes you, or will include you) call me Chris. I am originally from New Jersey but moved to Delaware
        at a very young age. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Ever since I was young, I have been obsessed with PC games and with that began my fascination for computers. I remember my family only having one computer 
        that I would have to take turns sharing with my older brother. A majority of my time chunk was spent playing games made then by gaming publisher Nexon, who specialized 
        in the MMORPG and Beat'em up genre. (Albeit I was bad, and still am) I later also loved to play League of Legends. Late 2000s and early 2010s was the prime for all of these games that I loved so much. 
        Even though I was interested in computers, a degree in the field wasn't my first thought during high school even though it made so much sense. Coming to college has been really eye-opening.
        </p> 
        <p>    
        I am currently a freshman at Cornell University (Go Big Red!) studying computer science. My reasoning for studying comp sci stems from this love for computers mentioned earlier.  
        I see now that it's the future of the world. The depth of topics is <i>extensive</i> and <i>mind boggling</i>. We find ourselves utilizing programming and computers more and more. There's no limit to 
        what you can do and I want to know how I can help expand the world of technology and address today's challenges (in part to which Google is leading the way). Just recently, I saw news of a
        professor in California briding the gap in computer accessibility in that he was able to utilize the motion of one's tongue to translate into action -- it's things like this that makes me appreciate
        computer science for it's potential. 
        </p>
        <p>I came to this internship knowing little to nothing about the world of software engineering to this scale, so I am excited to learn so many different things 
        and gain first-hand experience.

                This is Collegetown Bagels in Ithaca, NY. One of my favorite joints to eat at during any time of the day. They have this delicious bagel called the round house
                that has scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, and a hashbrown all on a rosemary salt bagel. It's my favorite thing to get

                This is from Mehak in Ithaca, NY. Another one of my favorites. I've never had Indian cuisine (to which they specialize)
                so trying Mehak was (and still is) a life changing experience.

                This was from the annual Apple Harvest Festival in Ithaca. Each year, Apple Harvest Festival hosts bushels full of apple farmers and lots of delicious
                apple-based products for one to try.
